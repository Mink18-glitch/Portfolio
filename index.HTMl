          This is my website that i'm hosting through netlify.
          My websites front end is completely coded by me with
          CSS and HTML. I really enjoyed making this website and
          plan on making more in the future hopefully with a 
          team to learn more from and to grow as a front-end web 
          developer. Here is my <a href="https://github.com/Mink18-glitch/Portfolio">Github</a> feel free to read my code.

          My businesses
        </h1><p>
          I have started three businesses in my past sense i was 10.
          Those businesses in this order ecommerce's website, Twitch
          Partnered streamer, and a mental health blog. The ecommerce
          business i started when i was 10 and at 12 i shut it down.
          I started twitch streaming business when i was around 13 
          and worked on it for about 4 years until i my stress from
          running multiple social media accounts, a discord, and a 
          twitch account was to much to handle.That's around when i
          Started running my mental health blog that is still up to
          this day. Here is the linkes to my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mink18">twitch</a> account and <a href="https://www.minkable.com/">blog</a>
          i don't have the ecommerce website up anymore so i can't
          give a link for that.
